### AWS Services
* [Amazon Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/)

* [Amazon Aurora Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/?nc=sn&loc=2&dn=6) - Database Service

## Instructions
### Local Testing
* Create **.env** file. Look at example.env
  * To generate custom salts `openssl rand -base64 35` - Will generate 35 character custom salts.
* `export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` - Will parallize the build of the docker image.
* Start Wordpress and Nginx. `docker-compose up`
* Start Mysql Server> `docker run --env-file .env --name wordpressdb --network wordpress_cloud_default -v "$PWD/database":/var/lib/mysql -p 3306:3306 -p 33060:33060 mysql:5`
* Connect to server at `http://localhost:7000`
* Should see the Wordpress Admin install page.

### Deploy to Fargate Service
* Need to create **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID** and **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY** secrets in Github Repo.
* Repo contains aws.yml file for uploading image to Amazon ECR.
* Checkout branch *deploy*
* Merge updates into *deploy*
* Push *deploy* to Github. Will automatically build the docker image and push it to AWS ECR.

## Development
### Complete environment including MySQL Server as part of compose file.
  * Change **WORDPRESS_DB_HOST** in **.env** file to `WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=localhost:/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock`
  * `docker-compose -f dev-docker-compose.yml up` - Will build the local container and configure with NGINX and MySQL Server. Edit .env file accordingly.
